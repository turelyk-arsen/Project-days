## Your first client

Congratulation!  
After a small talk at the cofee machine, a start-up decides to put trust in you for their website creation. The last intern, a designer, has made mockup with photoshop (.psd) for smartphone, tablet, and desktop.

Your today's job is to integrate this mockup and ( if there is time ) publish it online if possible.

**You have 6 hours to accomplish this mission.**

Off course your favorite teacher is there the whole day to help you whenever you need to :)

- First steps 1 : Where to start ?
  1. Visualize psd using Adobe XD
  2. You should have the img folder (images) you need.
  3. First create the HTML.
  4. Then work FIRST with the CSS (or SCSS/SASS) on the MOBILE version FIRST.
     - Hints
       - Are some external ressources required ? fonts maybe ?
       - DreamShare and Login/Signup are part of the header
       - Sign Up round border is the hover effect that also apply to "Log In"
       - All images can be put as background image with a cover size and a center position
       - In order to position the text at the bottom of the card you have to give a defined size to the card and apply a flex direction vertical and justify the content to the end.
       - Keep it simple and work section per section.
       - When lost, ask the senior for hint, advice or solution.
